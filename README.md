# Apollo Guidance Computer Exhibit

This project was developed as part of **EngEX 2025**, the engineering exhibition organized to celebrate the **75th Anniversary of the Faculty of Engineering, University of Peradeniya**.  

Our exhibit demonstrates how the **Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC)** and its **DSKY interface** worked during the Apollo lunar missions, combining hardware, software, and interactive learning.

## Project Overview

Our exhibit has three major components:

1. **AGC Software Simulation**  
   - Prototypes the Apollo Lunar Module landing sequence programs (P63 to P66).  
   - Simulates how the AGC executed commands step by step.  

2. **DSKY Hardware Prototype**  
   - Built using Arduino to replicate the Apollo DSKY (Display & Keyboard).  
   - Hardcoded values are displayed to mimic AGC outputs.  
   - Includes physical buttons for `VERB`, `NOUN`, and `PRO`.  

3. **Lunar Lander Game**  
   - A simple interactive game simulating a lunar landing attempt.  
   - Visitors could play and experience the challenge of controlling a lunar module.
