1. V37N63E  (Load landing programme 63)
    - Put 63 on PROG display

2. V06N61E  (Show Landing info)
    - Show Time to go in braking phase / Time until ignition / Cross-range distance
    - When time until ignition is 100 light up KEY REL

3. KEY REL  (View computer message)
    - View KEY REL message V50N18 (Ask permission to turn the ricket sideways)

4. PRO      (Proceed to turn the rocket sideways)
    - Give permission
    - 5s before ignition show V99N62 (5s before igniton asks do you want to land on moon?)

5. PRO      (Give permission to land)
    - Lights up VEL and ALT
    - Afte some time when altitude is right turns off both VEL and ALT

6. V06N63E (Show Diff in Accurate data and Measured Data)
    - Show Altitude discrepancy / Altitude / Change in altitude

7. V57E (Incorperate merginh high accurate data and already existing readings from the IMU)
    - No change happen on screen though
    - After sometime auto changes PROG to 64

8. V06N64E (Show Landing Co-ordinates)
    - Shows Landing point designator / Change in altitude / Altitude
    - Auto change PROG to 66 after 5s (**This happens when astronaut changes PNGS mode in the ship)

ERROR Simulation (5 Total Errors):

* During P63;

1. V37N63E (Load P63)
    - Show 63 on PROG

2. V16N68E (Show additional info of landing)
    - Shows Time until breaking phase / Velocity / Distance to landing site
    - After 3s light up PROG
    - After 5s light up RESTART

3. V05N09 (Show progeram alarms)
    - Shows 3 1202
    - After 5s computer restarts auto and resume at PROG 63

4. Repeat Steps 2 and 3
    - Shows erro 3 1201

5. Repeat Step 4
    - Shows error 3 1202

* 2 more simillar 1202/1201 errors happened during P64 due to heavy load. Those were not simulated in this.

* Errors stopped during P66 due to reducing load.
